### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & WSL Notes

	‚Ä¢	CLI works in WSL
	‚Ä¢	GUI requires macOS or Linux (may work in WSLg on Win11)
	‚Ä¢	Paths must be POSIX-style
	‚Ä¢	If `exec_type` is omitted or misconfigured in `tools.yaml`, the GUI may attempt to run the tool incorrectly.
	‚Ä¢	GUI execution behavior no longer depends on the `category` field.
	‚Ä¢	FLOSS may print a warning such as `from multiprocessing.resource_tracker import main;main(6)` due to a known bug in its multiprocessing logic. This does not affect output and can be safely ignored.
