### 🦈 TShark Field Reference Panel

If TShark is included in your `tools.yaml` (or if you’re using the REMnux configuration), the GUI provides an integrated reference panel for display filter fields.

- Launchable via the “?” icon next to filter fields
- Provides examples, tooltips, and a copy-to-clipboard feature
- Helps users construct and test display filters visually
