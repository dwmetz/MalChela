XMZMD5 recursively scans a directory and generates MD5 hashes for all files that do not match common binary or archive signatures such as MZ, ZIP, or PDF. Itâ€™s ideal for uncovering unusual or misclassified files that may require deeper inspection or reverse engineering. Use this on a malware corpus to help surface non-Windows malware samples.
