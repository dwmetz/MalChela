MZcount recursively scans a directory and counts the number of files that match key signatures like MZ (Windows executables), ZIP, PDF, and others. It uses lightweight YARA rules to classify files by type, giving a quick overview of the content breakdown within a dataset. Results can be displayed in either a detailed per-file view or a clean summary table, depending on your analysis needs.
