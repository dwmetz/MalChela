**Note:** `XMZHash` replaces the deprecated `XMZMd5`.

`XMZHash` recursively scans a directory and generates hashes for all files that **do not** match common binary or archive signatures such as MZ, ZIP, or PDF. Itâ€™s ideal for uncovering unusual or misclassified files that may require deeper inspection or reverse engineering. Use this on a malware corpus to help surface non-Windows malware samples.

You can select one or more hash algorithms at runtime: **MD5**, **SHA1**, or **SHA256**. If multiple algorithms are selected, a hash file and TSV lookup table will be generated for each.

The program outputs:
- A text file with one hash per line.
- A TSV (tab-separated values) file with full file paths and their corresponding hashes.

By default, hashes are saved to `saved_output/mzhash/`. If the file already exists, the user will be prompted before overwriting.

These hash sets (.tsv preferred) can be used with [HashCheck](hashcheck.md).

### ðŸ”§ CLI Syntax

```bash
cargo run -p xmzhash -- /path_to_directory/
```
*Generates SHA256 hashes (default).*

```bash
cargo run -p xmzhash -- -a MD5 -a SHA1 -a SHA256 /path_to_directory/
```
*Generates all three hash types.*

```bash
cargo run -p xmzhash -- -a SHA1 -a SHA256 /path_to_directory/
```
*Generates SHA1 and SHA256 only.*

```bash
cargo run -p xmzhash -- -a SHA256 /path_to_directory/ --case MyCase
```
*Saves results to the specified case folder.*

You can combine multiple `-a` flags in any order. If no directory is passed, you will be prompted.
