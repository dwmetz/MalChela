MalHash queries malware intelligence sources using a provided hash. It checks VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar for file metadata, threat labels, antivirus detections, and known associations. A quick way to enrich an unknown sample or confirm if a hash is already known and classified in the wild.

The first time you run MalHash, youâ€™ll be prompted to [configure API keys](../configuration/api-configuration.md) for VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar if theyâ€™re not already set.

### ðŸ”§ CLI Syntax

```bash
# Example 1: Lookup only
cargo run -p malhash -- d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

# Example 2: Save output as .txt
cargo run -p malhash -- d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e -o -t

# Example 3: Save output to a case folder
cargo run -p malhash -- d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e -o -t --case Case123
```

Use `-o` to save output and include one of the following format flags:
- `-t` â†’ Save as `.txt`
- `-j` â†’ Save as `.json`
- `-m` â†’ Save as `.md`

If no hash is provided, the tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

When `--case` is used, output is saved to:

```
saved_output/cases/Case123/malhash/
```

Otherwise, reports are saved to:

```
saved_output/malhash/
```
