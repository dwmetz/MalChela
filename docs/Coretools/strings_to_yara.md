Strings to YARA helps you rapidly build custom YARA rules by prompting for a rule name, optional metadata, and a list of string indicators. It integrates with the MalChela scratchpad, allowing you to paste or collect candidate strings interactively.

Lines beginning with hash: are deliberately ignored during rule generation â€” this lets you use the scratchpad to track hashes alongside strings without polluting your YARA rule content.
