   Features:
  </h3>

| Program             | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| Combine YARA        | Combines all `.yara`/`.yar` files in a directory into a single rule file |
| Extract Samples     | Recursively extracts password-protected malware archives (ZIP/RAR) using common passwords |
| File Analyzer       | Analyzes a file for hashes, entropy, PE structure, fuzzy hashes, YARA matches, NSRL lookup, and VirusTotal status |
| Hash It             | Generates MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes for a single file |
| Hash Check          | Checks if a given hash exists in a provided hash set file |
| Mismatch Miner      | Scans for executables masquerading as other file types (e.g., JPG, PDF) by detecting magic number mismatches |
| mStrings            | Extracts strings from a file, applies regex and Sigma rules, maps to MITRE ATT&CK, and identifies IOCs |
| mzhash              | Recursively hashes files with MZ headers using MD5 ‚Äî ideal for gold build or known-bad corpus generation |
| mzcount             | Recursively counts files by format (MZ, ZIP, PDF, etc.) using header/YARA detection |
| nsrlquery           | Queries an MD5 hash against the NSRL database to determine if it‚Äôs known-good |
| strings_to_yara     | Prompts for metadata and a string list to generate a YARA rule |
| xmzhash             | Recursively hashes files that are *not* MZ, ZIP, or PDF ‚Äî ideal for  non-Windows malware corpus |

**The Malware Hash Lookup requires an api key for Virus Total and Malware Bazaar.  If unidentified , MalChela will prompt you to create them the first time you run the malware lookup function.*

   About:
   </h3>

> **mal** ‚Äî malware</p>
> **chela** ‚Äî ‚Äúcrab hand‚Äù</p>
> A chela on a crab is the scientific term for a claw or pincer. It‚Äôs a specialized appendage, typically found on the first pair of legs, used for grasping, defense, and manipulating things;  just like these programs.

<h3>
Dependencies:
</h3>

```
sudo apt install openssl libssl-dev clang yara libyara-dev pkg-config build-essential libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

<h3>
Installation & Usage:
</h3>

Install Rust - https://rustup.rs/</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/dwmetz/MalChela.git
cd MalChela
cargo build
```

<h3>
Run:
</h3>

```
cargo run -p malchela

```
or 

```
cargo run -p MalChelaGUI

```
<h3>üîß Adding Custom Tools:</h3>

You can extend MalChela by editing the `tools.yaml` file to add third-party or custom tools to the GUI. This flexible configuration supports binaries, Python scripts, and Rust-based programs.

Each entry defines the tool‚Äôs name, category, execution type, how input is passed (file, folder, or hash), and any optional arguments. Here are a few sample entries:

```yaml
- name: capa
  description: "Detects capabilities in binaries via rules"
  command: ["capa"]
  input_type: "file"
  category: "File Analysis"
  exec_type: binary
  file_position: "last"
  optional_args: []

- name: strings
  description: "Extracts printable strings from binaries"
  command: ["strings"]
  input_type: "file"
  category: "Utilities"
  exec_type: binary
  file_position: "first"
  optional_args: []

- name: pdf-parser
  description: "Parses and analyzes suspicious PDF structures"
  command: ["python3"]
  input_type: "file"
  category: "PDF Analysis"
  exec_type: script
  file_position: "last"
  optional_args: ["tools/pdf-parser/pdf-parser.py"]
```

ü¶Ä **REMnux Mode:**  
When run on a REMnux system, MalChela can load a REMnux-specific `tools.yaml` file tailored for the built-in tools available in that distro. This ensures smoother setup with minimal configuration required.


üìù **Notes:**
- Tools must be in your system `PATH` or include a full/relative path.
- `exec_type` must be one of: `cargo`, `binary`, or `script`.
- `file_position` indicates where the input is placed in the command (`first` or `last`).
- See the [MalChela User Guide](https://dwmetz.github.io/MalChela/) for detailed configuration examples and workflows.

<h3>
Enhanced Tool Support:
</h3>

MalChela v2.2.0 includes improved integration with the following third-party tools:

- **Volatility 3**: Dynamic plugin builder, argument templating, and output directory selection.
- **TShark**: Visual reference panel and support for capturing filtered traffic with custom syntax.
- **YARA-X**: Smart rule matching with improved argument handling and REMnux-compatible default configuration.

These enhancements make working with memory images, PCAPs, and YARA rules more streamlined for forensic workflows.

#### Caveat Emptor:
Successfully tested on MacOS on Silicon and Ubuntu. Even though it's Rust (cross-platform), Windows is problematic based on different requirements for YARA64.exe. Works on Windows in WSL! Testers (and contributors) appreciated.
