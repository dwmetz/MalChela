Network Collections:
</h5>

CyberPipe 5 also has the capability to write captures to a network repository. Just un-comment # the Network section and update the `\\server\share` line to reflect your environment.

In this configuration it can be included as part of automation functions like a collection being triggered from an event logged on the EDR.

<h5>
   Prior version (KAPE support):
</h5>

If you're a prior user of CyberPipe and want to use the previous method where KAPE facilitates the collection with the MAGNET tools, or have made other KAPE modifications, use v4.01 `CyberPipe.v4.01.ps1`
