FileAnalyzer performs deep static analysis on a single file. It extracts hashes, entropy, file type metadata, YARA rule matches, NSRL validation, and â€” for PE files â€” rich header details including import/export tables, compile timestamp, and section flags. Ideal for triaging unknown executables or confirming known file traits.
