### 🧩 FLOSS Notes

- FLOSS extracts static, stack, tight, and decoded strings from binaries.
- The GUI supports all CLI flags (e.g., `—only`, `—format`, `-n`, etc.).
- Occasionally, FLOSS may print a multiprocessing-related error such as:
  `from multiprocessing.resource_tracker import main;main(6)`
  This is a known issue and does not affect output. It can be safely ignored.
